##  Question 1: What is Decision Analysis & Why is it Important?

**Decision Analysis** is a way to help us make smart choices when we have many options. It’s useful in business, tech, and even daily life because it helps reduce risks and leads to better decisions.

**Example:**  
My friend had to choose a school for exchange. He listed out things like tuition, living costs, rankings, and language, then picked the one that fit him best using a decision analysis approach.

##  Question 2: Comparing Decision-Making Methods

Let’s compare **SAW (Simple Additive Weighting)** and **TOPSIS**:

| Feature | SAW | TOPSIS |
|--------|-----|--------|
| Pros   | Super easy and fast to calculate | Considers both best and worst options |
| Cons   | Too simple, may miss key factors | More complex, needs normalization |
| Best For | Quick decisions (e.g., choosing a supplier) | More detailed ones (e.g., investment ranking) |

**Which one for investment?**  
I’d say **TOPSIS** is better for ranking investments, because it looks at how close each option is to the best (and far from the worst), which gives more balanced results.

##  Question 3: How Criteria Choices Affect the Outcome

The criteria and weights we choose really matter. If we leave out something important or give the wrong weight, we might make a bad decision.

**Example:**  
At school, we once picked a team leader based only on competition scores. We ignored things like leadership and communication. The person we chose wasn’t good at leading, and the team vibe got worse. So yeah—bad criteria = bad results.
